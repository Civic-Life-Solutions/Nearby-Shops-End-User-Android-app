Concept
----------
Nearby Shops is a Hyerlocal Shopping platform where a customer can buy directly from the shops available in his/her local area and get his orders delivered to the home or just pick the order from the shop if home delivery is not available. 

In the new emerging world customers are getting tired of daily shopping routine of going outside for shopping. They would much prefer if they can simply place an order and get the products delivered to their Home the same day. 

The conventional e-commerce has issues ... the delivery takes a long time and its more difficult to trust the vendors which you cannot see and meet physically. Hyperlocal e-commerce tends to solve these issues because delivery is faster and customers can reach out to the vendors easily. 

Nearby Shops can also be used as a food Delivery platform where restaurants can use it to deliver food instead of items. 

Nearby Shops implements Alibaba's New Offline-to-Online Concept where customers discover products online and then pick those products from Physical Stores.

Tech Stack and app Architecture
--------------------------------

Uses Android Jetpack and Google‚Äôs Recommended Architecture Patterns - Migeration to MVVM is planned

Written in both Java and Kotlin : Migeration to kotlin is planned and will be coming in near future

Built using Butterknife, Retrofit, Ok-HTTP, Picasso, Dagger, Mapbox android SDK

Software is made of modular View-Holder Pattern which makes the UI blocks modular and easy to reuse, modify and understand.

The app uses Single activity Architecture where most of the screens are implemented as fragments and there are only 2-3 activities in the entire project.

The project has 3 android apps each for End-User, Shop-Owner and adminstrator and a JSON based REST API at the backend. The Source for REST API is provided.

Development Instructions
-------------------------

If you're a developer looking to work on the source code follow these instructions to start developing !

```js
git clone https://github.com/SumeetMoray/Nearby-Shops-End-User-Android-app.git
```

You should now open the project with the latest version of Android Studio. The project will not compile unless you add the following property in the local.properties file. 

This project uses mapbox android sdk which requires mapbox style url. To add the style url in the project open this project in the android studio and add the Mapbox Style URL in the local.properties file. 

It is okay if you dont have an actual Mapbox style url in that case just put some dummy text in place of url. 

```js
mapbox_style_url="your-mapbox-style-url"
```
